### Download This Notebook

You can download an R Notebook version of this lesson to follow along with 
[here](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/2018-03-29-R-Workshop/blob/gh-pages/03-R_Notebooks.nb.html.zip).

### About R Notebooks

This is an [R Markdown Notebook](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebooks.html). When you execute code within the notebook, the 
results appear beneath the code.

We will talk more about R Markdown on Day 2, and all the wonderful things you can do using it to create documents, but today we 
are going to focus on using R Markdown Notebooks to create reproducible code.

Briefly, R Markdown is a simple way to create documents with formatting by using specific symbols and characters. Programs capable 
of reading R Markdown can render a nicely formatted document. This is similar to the way that HTML files are text documents with 
specific tags, which are read by specific programs (web browsers, etc.) that apply those tags to the text, interpret the 
formatting, apply it to the document, and display it. R Markdown files (and R Notebooks) have the base file extension *.Rmd. An R 
Notebook will have the line 
output: html_notebook
in the header. 

R Notebooks have a few extra features over regular R Markdown documents:

* When you execute code in a Notebook, it is done line by line, so it can be easier to check execution for errors. In a regular R 
Markdown document, code is executed all at once.

* You can *Preview* your notebook using the *Preview* button - this displays a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor, 
but does not actually run any code. This makes it a bit faster to check your output.

* When you save your notebook, it creates a special *.nb.html file, which is actually a package of the HTML rendering (of the 
page, with the code sections as separate image files in their own directory) and the Markdown file. This can be shared with 
others and opened like a regular fine from within RStudio.


### Text Formatting

To create a new R Markdown Notebook in RStudio, select File -> New File -> R Notebook.

You can enter text into a Notebook as you normally would into any other text document and use Markdown conventions to format it.

Enter text between the double asterisks below to format it as bold:
** **

Enter text between the underscores below to format it as italic:
_ _

Click Preview when you are finished to view your changes.

Take advantage of this to document your code and data to keep it readable, understandable, and reproducible!


### Embedding Code Chunks

You can embed R code into Notebooks by using chunks, set off above and below by three reverse ticks: ``` 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button (small green arrow) within the chunk or by placing your cursor 
inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*.

```{r}
a <- 17
b <- 34
a + b
```

The designation {r} tells the Notebook that this is executable R code.

Here's another example - run it the same way:

```{r cars_plot}
plot(cars)
```

The 'cars' dataset is an example dataset built into R, and the 'plot' command is a basic R command to create a default plot of 
simple data. We'll talk more about plotting using ggplot later on in this workshop.

Note the addition of *cars_plot* in the {r} designation - this is the name of the code chunk. This can be used to 
navigate your Notebook using the menu in the lower left of the document window. It is also used when you are calling 
an external R script into a Notebook, and we'll see an example of that in the next example. You can also add sections to your document using headings designated by `###` - you'll learn more about that tomorrow.

Add a new chunk in the space below by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*. 
Name your chunk 'math_trick'.
Perform the following operations:
Assign your shoe size to a variable. Then:
1. Multiply this variable by 5.
2. Add 50.
3. Multiply by 20.
4. Add 1017 (1018 if you have already had your birthday this year)
5. Subtract the year you were born.
6. Display the answer.

Insert code chunk here

If you wanted to call this **script** in multiple Notebooks, you could save it as an R code file:

1. Click File -> New File -> R Script.
2. Copy and paste your code into the new file.
3. Add the line `## ---- math_trick` at the top of your file.
4. Save your file as `math_trick.R`.
5. You can now call this R script in any R chunk in any R Notebook using the line `knitr::read_chunk("math_trick.R")`.


### Save and Preview

After you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved
alongside it when you click the *Preview* button (or press *Cmd+Shift+K*) to preview 
the HTML file.
